# Zentra 

Zentra is a future-proof chain thanks to its unique design called Minus Theory. Which decouples consensus from execution via an indexer, which enables a new way to scale without compromising security, and creativity of the language. With a native Python Virtual Machine (VM), Zentra aims to onboard the next wave of developers—especially those in AI, data science, and DePIN—by making blockchain development accessible, upgradable and performance-optimized.
